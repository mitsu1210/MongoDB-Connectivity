# MongoDB-Connectivity
MongoDB is an open source database which stores data in the form of document. A document is a data structure that stores data in the form of &#39;Key-Value&#39; pair. Its advantages include ease of scalability, flexibility in storage of data, no complex joins, faster access of data.MongoDB can be compared with relational databases with the following analogies.

i. The database of relational model is equivalent to database in MongoDB.
ii. The tables of relational database are stored as collections in MongoDB.
iii. The rows of relational database are stored as documents in MongoDB.

Since MongoDB is a schema less database, each document can hold different number of fields and content. MongoDB allows indexing on any of the fields making it more flexible as compared to relational databases. Due to its feature of replication, MongoDB has a higher availability factor as against relational databases.

The front end of the application is designed using HTML files, which are present in the folder Web Content in the provided folder. The connectivity to database is done using Servlets, the code for which are in .java files which are added separately in this folder.
